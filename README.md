# What The Hack - Azure OpenAI Fundamentals

## Introduction

The AI Fluency Event is an introduction to understanding the conceptual foundations of Azure OpenAI models. Materials from this hack can serve as a foundation for building your own solution with Azure OpenAI. This initiative is based on a GPS FY24 OKR to increase Partner Solution Architects' capability, capacity, and confidence to lead AI-related partner engagements. 

This hack consists of four challenges. It will be hosted as a 2 day event and is a team based activity where students work in group of 3-5 people to solve the challenges. Whether you have limited to no experience with Machine Learning or have experimented with OpenAI before but want a deeper understanding of how to implement an AI solution, this hack is for you.


## Learning Objectives

This hack is for anyone who wants to gain hands-on experience experimenting with prompt engineering and machine learning best practices, and apply them to generate effective responses from Azure OpenAI models.

Participants will learn how to:

- Compare Azure OpenAI models and choose the best one for a scenario
- Use prompt engineering techniques on complex tasks
- Manage large amounts of data within token limits, including the use of chunking and chaining techniques
- Grounding models to avoid hallucinations or false information
- Implement embeddings using search retrieval techniques

Evaluate models for truthfulness and monitor for PII detection in model interactions

## Challenges

- Challenge 00: **[Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!](challenges/Challenge-00.md)**
	 - Prepare your workstation to work with Azure.
- Challenge 01: **[Prompt Engineering](challenges/Challenge-01.md)**
	 - What's possible through Prompt Engineering 
	 - Best practices when using OpenAI text and chat models
- Challenge 03: **[Grounding, Chunking, and Embedding](challenges/Challenge-03.md)**
	 - Why is grounding important and how can you ground a Large Language Model (LLM)?
	 - What is a token limit? How can you deal with token limits? What are techniques of chunking?
- Challenge 04: **[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](challenges/Challenge-04.md)**
	 - How do we create ChatGPT-like experiences on Enterprise data? In other words, how do we "ground" powerful LLMs to primarily our own data?
- Challenge 05: **[Responsible AI](challenges/Challenge-05.md)**
	 - What are services and tools to identify and evaluate harms and data leakage in LLMs?
	 - What are ways to evaluate truthfulness and reduce hallucinations?
What are methods to evaluate a model if you don't have a ground truth dataset for comparison?

## Prerequisites

- Access to an Azure Subscription
	- If you don't have one, [Sign Up for Azure HERE](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) 
- [Access to Azure OpenAI](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUOFA5Qk1UWDRBMjg0WFhPMkIzTzhKQ1dWNyQlQCN0PWcu)
