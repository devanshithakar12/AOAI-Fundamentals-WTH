In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain-of- thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a PaLM 540B with just eight chain-of-thought exemplars achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier. Standard Prompting Model Input Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? A: The answer is 11. Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have? Chain-of-Thought Prompting Model Input Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11. Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have? Model Output Model Output A: The answer is 27. x A: The cafeteria had 23 apples originally. They used 20 to make lunch. So they had 23 - 20 = 3. They bought 6 more apples, so they have 3 + 6 = 9.

Scaling up the size of lan- guage models has been shown to confer a range of benefits, such as improved performance and sample efficiency (Ka- plan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020, inter alia). However, scaling up model size alone has not proved sufficient for achieving high performance on challenging tasks such as arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (Rae et al., 2021). Both of the above ideas, however, have key limitations. For rationale-augmented training and finetuning methods, it is costly to create a large set of high quality rationales, which is much more complicated than simple input\u2013output pairs used in normal machine learning. For the traditional few- shot prompting method used in Brown et al. (2020), it works poorly on tasks that require reasoning abilities, and often does not improve substantially with increasing language model scale (Rae et al., 2021). In this paper, we combine the strengths of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations. Specifically, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning tasks, given a prompt that consists of triples: input, chain of thought, output . A chain of thought is a series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the final output, and we refer to this approach as chain-of-thought prompting. An example prompt is shown in Figure 1. We present empirical evaluations on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks, showing that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting, sometimes to a striking degree. Figure 2 illustrates one such result\u2014on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), chain-of-thought prompting with PaLM 540B outperforms standard prompting by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. A prompting only approach is important because it does not require a large training dataset and because a single model checkpoint can perform many tasks without loss of generality. This work underscores how large language models can learn via a few examples with natural language data about the task (c.f. automatically learning the patterns underlying inputs and outputs via a large training dataset). 2 Chain-of-Thought Prompting Consider one\u2019s own thought process when solving a complicated reasoning task such as a multi-step math word problem. It is typical to decompose the problem into intermediate steps and solve each before giving the final answer: \u201cAfter Jane gives 2 flowers to her mom she has 10 . . . then after she gives 3 to her dad she will have 7 . . . so the answer is 7.\u201d The goal of this paper is to endow language models with the ability to generate a similar chain of thought\u2014a coherent series of intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final answer for a problem. We will show that sufficiently large 2 Finetuned GPT-3 175B Prior best PaLM 540B: standard prompting PaLM 540B: chain-of-thought prompting 100 Solve rate (%) 80 57 60 55 40 33 18 0 Math Word Problems (GSM8K) 20 Figure 2: PaLM 540B uses chain-of- thought prompting to achieve new state- of-the-art performance on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems. Finetuned GPT-3 and prior best are from Cobbe et al. (2021). This work explores how the reasoning ability of large language models can be unlocked by a simple method motivated by two ideas. First, techniques for arithmetic reasoning can benefit from generating natural language rationales that lead to the final answer. Prior work has given models the ability to generate natural language inter- mediate steps by training from scratch (Ling et al., 2017) or finetuning a pretrained model (Cobbe et al., 2021), in addition to neuro-symbolic methods that use formal lan- guages instead of natural language (Roy and Roth, 2015; Chiang and Chen, 2019; Amini et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). Second, large language models offer the exciting prospect of in-context few-shot learning via prompting. That is, instead of finetuning a separate language model checkpoint for each new task, one can simply \u201cprompt\u201d the model with a few input\u2013output exemplars demonstrating the task. Remarkably, this has been successful for a range of simple question-answering tasks (Brown et al., 2020)."}]}
